# Parallel Search of Articulation Points
This is the program, written in Java, that searches for articulation points in the graph using Bread-First-Search (BFS) and brute-force algorithms. It makes a use of Apache Spark to parallelize execution of data-involved tasks among remote computing nodes during the searching process. It can also be used with the single local computing node, when this local comput.

## Theory of articulation points
Articulation points are the nodes of the graph such that, when removed, cause a fission of the graph into two or more unconnected, non-linked graphs.

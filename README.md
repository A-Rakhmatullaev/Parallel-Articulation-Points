# Parallel Search of Articulation Points
This is the program, written on Java, that searches for articulation points in the graph using Bread-First-Search (BFS) and brute-force algorithms. It makes a use of Apache Spark to parallelize execution of data-involved tasks among remote computing nodes during the searching process.
